# Objective 
- Learn how to make game engine with C++, Lua, & SDL
- This is not a How-To-Do Instruction (It is for reference purposes)

# Technologies
- C++
- GLM for math (ex: vector)
- SDL for easy memory allocation from OS
- Lua for scripting language

# Important Branch
- [1. Setup completed for the first time in Windows OS](https://github.com/jinheehanaaa/2D-Game-Engine-with-CPP-LUA-and-SDL/tree/5679f7385963dd234a4953f9d47ce691cb4a083d)
- [2. Update in Game Loop with proper delta time method](https://github.com/jinheehanaaa/2D-Game-Engine-with-CPP-LUA-and-SDL/tree/12638eb15da786823de46f9a7e3e2ae9cc1b4b4c)
